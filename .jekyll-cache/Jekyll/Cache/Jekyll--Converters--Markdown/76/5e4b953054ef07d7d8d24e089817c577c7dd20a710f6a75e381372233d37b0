I"ú<p>Do you remember when the Buzzfeed and Buzzfeed-like news stories were everywhere? When you would probably see 50 different links on your social media feed about â€œClick here to understand which character from Friends you are!â€ or â€œChoose to be outstanding (or choose to continue to suck)â€. What is the difference between this with the â€œUltimate Guide to Data Science in 10 minutesâ€? In the last couple of years, Iâ€™ve been feeling that Data Science blogs caught the clickbait disease in a big way. Since I am a Data Scientist, this piece will be mostly about Data Science blogs, but Iâ€™d like to hear if you have similar experiences in other blogs.</p>

<h1 id="technical-clickbait">Technical Clickbait??</h1>
<p>This complaint isnâ€™t about the quality of the articles, more about the misleading and click maximisation characteristic of the title. It is hard to come up with a title for your piece, but â€œThe Best Way to Become A Data Scientist in 6 monthsâ€, isnâ€™t an honest way to do it. When you name your blog post in such a way, to put a footnote like â€œOh, this is just my experience.â€ doesnâ€™t add up. I canâ€™t deny that I read articles that had good content that had this initial attitude, but I think this sloppy approach seeps into the quality article quite often.</p>

<p>These kinds of titles create much excitement especially when you are new in a field. As you mature in a field, it is easier to differentiate but a beginner is more likely to be misled and waste an unnecessary amount of time until the fully negligible footnote that says â€œthe Ultimate Guideâ€ is just a product of the personal experience.</p>

<p>While writing this I am mainly thinking about the kind of mass articles that are being published on Medium. The push to have more than enough content for people to consume with the free articles and the optimization scheme the platform uses (show enough from the start of the article so that the user will want to make the purchase), is pushing most of these users to use such tactics. Gaming the recommendation engine is the most common route to follow these days.</p>

<p>I feel quite uneasy about the bad precedents these approaches are making in the community. As the clickbait multiply and take over the recommendations, how likely is it for the people learning about the field to write more articles like that in the future? There always were bad and good blog posts and there always be ones on either side of the spectrum but I think the skew towards the bad practices could be the difference between a community people will want to be in or not.</p>

<h1 id="why-did-we-have-clickbait-in-the-first-place">Why did we have clickbait in the first place?</h1>
<p>A good explanation of what clickbait is: â€œA link with a headline that encourages people to see more, without telling them much information about what they will see.â€ The cliff-hanger leaves our mind to be in a state of intense curiosity, the readers will want to resolve by clicking the link. However, while the click rates are increased, it also reduced the time people spend reading the article.</p>

<p>It is quite clear isnâ€™t it: news channels needed more people to get onto their sites to sell ads, and that is the easiest way to do it. The same is going on with the blogs. The calls of â€œeveryone should blog!â€ has been heard loud and clear, there is an immense number of people blogging in Data Science, and with a task that is as tough as writing your thoughts, people also want attention. Thus, we have the â€œThe Ultimate Guides to Xâ€. Clickbait is like the experiment where the researchers want to robot to minimize foot contact and maximize speed, the robot ended up walking on its back instead. The writers want more people reading their hard work (foot contact), the platforms want more clicks (the walking speed), from optimizing both we are getting not the highest quality but the shiniest pieces among the blogs.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-avoid-looking-like-a-clickbait">How to avoid looking like a clickbait?</h1>
<p>After reading on the subject for a bit, these would be my guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First step is to describe what the article contains. â€œThe Ultimate Guide to Pre-processingâ€ vs â€œHow to decide which scaler to use?â€, the former is flat out wrong and misleading anyway unless you have written 3 books inside that article, the latter is focused and reasonable.</li>
  <li>Try to also keep an eye out for the most common types of titles going around: â€œHow to Create A Deep Learning Model with Keras in 10 secondsâ€ is overdone. Also, I never understood how this is an enticing title. How would doing a technically complex thing in a short amount of time help anybody? It is much better to put a couple of time aside later down the line and learn it properly.</li>
  <li>Sense check is always relevant. The initial title of this article was â€œThe Ultimate Guide to Not To Trust Ultimate Guidesâ€, because of a conversation we had with a friend a couple of months back. After writing this down, it went against the points I am trying to make here.</li>
</ul>

<p>These points are relevant if the main reason for blogging is to take notes for your future self and contribute to the community in one way or another. In any of the cases, I want to believe writing a post with well-thought content would prevail. One contrary subject here might be that if you are trying to make money out of your Medium articles. If thatâ€™s the case, best of luck. It is a cruel world out there.</p>
